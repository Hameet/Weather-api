# Weather api with animation using 'react-animated-weather'

## This project involves integrating the 'react-animated-weather' npm package to work in tandem with the openweathermap API. 

# Challanges faced by me:
1) While accessing the API was easy enough integrating the weather animation package required some brain storming
2) There are way too many weather codes for different conditions, still looking for a better alternative than using a For loop
3) Information provided by the weather API is also limited and sometimes inaccurate
4) Faced numerous problems with Heroku as the build kept failing, had to redo the whole thing from scratch
